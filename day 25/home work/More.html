        <li>In Rainbows (2007)

            The Beautiful One.
            Emotionally rich, sonically warm, and full of groove. In Rainbows feels alive and intimate — less anxious than their previous work, but no less deep.
            
                Why it’s beloved: It’s accessible and profound. Fans often call this their most “human” album.
            
                Essential tracks: “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi,” “Nude,” “Reckoner,” “All I Need”
            
        <li>The Bends (1995)

            A huge leap forward. More complex songwriting, emotional depth.
        
            Big songs: “Fake Plastic Trees”, “High and Dry”, “Street Spirit (Fade Out)”.
        
            Mixed vulnerability and guitar-driven intensity. Critics and fans took notice.</li>
        <li>Kid A (2000)

            The real curveball. No radio singles, hardly any guitars.
        
            Heavily electronic, abstract, influenced by Aphex Twin, krautrock, ambient, and jazz.
        
            Fans were shocked at first — now it's considered a masterpiece.
        
            Key tracks: “Everything In Its Right Place”, “How to Disappear Completely”, “Idioteque”.</li>
