        Who is Radiohead, really?

Formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire in 1985 while they were still in school, the band originally went by the name On a Friday (because that’s when they rehearsed). They signed with EMI in the early '90s and became Radiohead, a name taken from a Talking Heads song.

Members:

    Thom Yorke – vocals, guitar, piano, songwriting, face of the band

    Jonny Greenwood – lead guitar, synths, multi-instrumental genius

    Ed O’Brien – guitar, backing vocals, ambient textures

    Colin Greenwood – bass, Jonny's older brother, glue of the rhythm

    Philip Selway – drums, percussion, always in the pocket

 Why They Matter

They’re not just a band — they’re a musical evolution engine. Every few years they’ve shed their skin and become something new. Some reasons they stand out:

    Fearless reinvention: Rock to electronic to orchestral to ambient — they follow instinct, not trends.

    Emotional depth: Their music often explores alienation, anxiety, love, death, climate despair, and modern disconnection — deeply human stuff.

    Sonic innovation: They pioneered new ways of blending genres, recording, and distributing music.

    Ethics & independence: They left major labels behind, gave fans flexible pricing (In Rainbows), and have used their platform to support causes like climate change and refugee rights.

 Jonny Greenwood’s Genius

He deserves a special shoutout. Classically trained, wildly inventive, and a key force in shaping the band's sound. Beyond Radiohead, he's scored many films — especially for director Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread). His work blends modern classical with strange, beautiful tension.
 Side Projects & Solo Work

    Thom Yorke has solo albums (The Eraser, ANIMA), a new band called The Smile (with Jonny and drummer Tom Skinner), and electronic side ventures.

    Ed O’Brien released a solo album (Earth) with more uplifting and expansive vibes.

    Philip Selway has made solo albums, too — more intimate, singer-songwriter style.

 Influence

Their impact is enormous. Without Radiohead, we might not have:

    The experimental leaps taken by artists like James Blake, Bon Iver, Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, and Billie Eilish

    Bands like Muse, Coldplay, and Travis finding their footing

    The shift in album releases and indie-label dynamics

They made it okay to be weird. To feel weird. To explore without knowing the destination.
